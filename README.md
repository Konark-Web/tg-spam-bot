My project for Vistula University (Python and Artificial Intelligence).

For the project I used:
- aiogram (for telegram bot api management)
- pandas (to work with data)
- nltk (to clean up data)
- sklearn (for model training)
- joblib (for saving and loading the model)


How to deploy on your server:
1. Create a .env file and insert the bot's telegram token `TOKEN="your token"` there
2. Run the bot with `python main.py`
3. To train the model in your personal message, enter the command _/train_model_
4. Add the bot to your chat and use it!

The bot is designed to learn how to work with pandas and sklearn and is far from perfect.
